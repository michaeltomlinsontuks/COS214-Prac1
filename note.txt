- We need to change the copy constructor the shapes to make use of pointers for their copying 

Rectangle::Rectangle(const Shape *copy)
    : Shape(copy)
{
    // Logger::getInstance()->info("Rectangle copied with values: length = " + std::to_string(copy->length) + ", width = " + std::to_string(copy.width) + ", colour = " + copy.colour + ", position_x = " + std::to_string(copy.position_x) + ", position_y = " + std::to_string(copy.position_y));
}

// our responsibility to make sure a square doesnt use the rectangles copy contructor (even though it would work)

Add all the getters and setters for shapes *michael job :)

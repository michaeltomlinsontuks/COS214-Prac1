15.1 About OpenCanvas
     OpenCanvas is a free design platform that allows users to create
     and manipulate shapes on a canvas. This CLI version demonstrates
     key design patterns used in the system.

15.2 Design Patterns Used
     15.2.1 Factory Method Pattern
            - Used for creating different types of shapes (Rectangle, Square, Textbox)
            - Each shape type has its own factory class
            - Allows easy addition of new shape types
     
     15.2.2 Prototype Pattern
            - Used for duplicating existing shapes
            - Each shape can clone itself with identical properties
            - Useful for creating multiple similar shapes
     
     15.2.3 Template Method Pattern
            - Used for exporting canvas to different formats (PNG, PDF)
            - Defines common export steps: prepare → render → save
            - Each format implements steps differently
     
     15.2.4 Memento Pattern
            - Used for undo functionality
            - Saves canvas state before each action
            - Allows restoration to previous state

15.3 Shape Properties
     - All shapes have: length, width, colour, X position, Y position
     - Textboxes additionally have: text content
     - Shapes are identified by unique IDs
     - Coordinates start from (0,0) at top-left

15.4 Available Colours
     - Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Black, White
     - Colours are case-sensitive

15.5 Usage Tips
     - Always check "Show All Shapes" to see current shape IDs
     - Use "Display Canvas" to see visual representation
     - Export functions will save files to current directory
     - Undo only works for the last action performed
     - Clear Canvas will remove all shapes permanently

15.6 Navigation
     - Enter menu numbers to select options
     - Use decimal notation for submenus (e.g., 1.1, 1.2)
     - Each submenu has "Back to Main Menu" option
     - Invalid inputs will show error and return to menu

15.7 Troubleshooting
     - If shape ID not found, use "Show All Shapes" first
     - Textbox operations only work on Textbox shapes
     - Export requires valid filename (no special characters)
     - Undo will show message if no previous state exists

It might be useful to have two main files: a testing main for FitchFork and a demo main with
a more user-friendly interface (e.g., a terminal menu) for demoing. This is just a suggestion,
not a requirement. You are required to have at least a testing main. If you choose to have a
demo main, upload it to FitchFork as well, but ensure it does not compile and run with make
run.

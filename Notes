Prototype:
    - Shape has private properties - No protected properties?
        - Rectangle, Square, Textbox (Concrete Product Classes)
          • Inherit from Shape
          • Only Textbox has an additional attribute text.
            This is the text that a textbox can contain.
        - This implies the fields are meant to be protected.
        - Answer: the private is fine for inheritance,
         and because we are using clone we don't want ot be able to access the base class

##
For prototype we are going to need getters and setters, since the values are private, we should add those 
##


ToString: What is the output they want?
    - I think fitchfork just checks coverage so it doesn't matter.
    - We'll have to pick something that makes sense for the demo.
